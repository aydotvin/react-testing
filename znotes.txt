Jest:
{
	-	This helps in running the test and providing proper messages accordingly.
	-	This provides methods such as test and expect globally to use with RTL methods.

	-	test method:
	{
		-	test.only() to run only that test in a test file with multiple tests.
		-	test.skip() to skip that test in the test file with multiple tests.
		-	"it" can be used as alternate for "test"
		-	"fit" for test.only and "xit" for test.skip
	}

	-	describe method:
	{
		-	This is used to group the tests together.
		-	This supports .only and .skip and behaviour remains same as above.
		-	Possible to nest describe blocks.
	}

	-	Naming conventions:
	{
		-	.test.js, .test.tsx
		-	.spec.js, .spec.tsx
		-	.js, .tsx in __tests__ folder
	}
}

RTL:
{
	-	This provides methods such as render, screen, etc. which helps in actual testing.
	-	
}

TDD:
{
	Step 1: Write down the requirement in the test file.
	Step 2: Write the test which fails initially.
	Step 3: Write the software code to pass the test.
	Step 4: Refractor the code while ensuring tests pass.
}

Naming conventions:
{
	-	Jest a
}

Note:
{
	-	"Test Suite" is one test file.
