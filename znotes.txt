Jest:
{
	-	This helps in running the test and providing proper messages accordingly.
	-	This provides methods such as test and expect globally to use with RTL methods.

	-	test method:
	{
		-	test.only() to run only that test in a test file with multiple tests.

}

TDD:
{
	Step 1: Write down the requirement in the test file.
	Step 2: Write the test which fails initially.
	Step 3: Write the software code to pass the test.
	Step 4: Refractor the code while ensuring tests pass.
